Personal Web Page - Marko G

This is my personal web page. It contains four different web pages. Each page has its own stylesheet. 
It is possibile to get from any page to any other page of these four by following hyperlinks. Also, index.html contains links to some other pages on the web.

Swimming.hrml file includes an unordered list, wedding.html includes a table and index.html includes a picture.

Stylesheets have many different CSS properties and CSS selectors. I use #id selector in swimming and wedding page. Selector .class is used in all four pages.

Swimming.html and wedding.html use mobile responsive @media query for changing style on smaller screens.

Bootstrap 4 components are used for wedding page with two Bootstrap 4 columns and a grid.

Index page uses scss variables and scss nesting. Inharitance is used in resume.scss.
